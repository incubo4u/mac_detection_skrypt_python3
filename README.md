# mac_detection_skrypt_python3
It is a simple script that uses arp commands to check the presence of the previously given devices in our network on the basis of mac addresses.

Tested only on linux but should work on other operating systems as well. in case of problems it is enough to change the arp command (change to "arp -a", for example).
